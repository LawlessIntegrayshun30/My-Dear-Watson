## Original Requirements

Develop an application that can be run from a server or the cloud that is essentially a team of Ai models that work together as a private investigation firm. Each model can have a working knowledge of each aspect of the firm, but ultimately specializes in one of the technical proficiencies utilized by the firm to conduct thorough investigations. These investigations could be for cyber crimes or matters of business and personal nature that don't necessarily happen in cyber space, but the firm can utilize digital information like CCTV feeds, credit card receipts, OSINT, etc to gather intel as it pertains to each case. Please include a comprehensive 'Read Me' file (not a Read Me generator). Also please make it launch ready, and fully functional so that when it is put through Continuous Integration, there are no failed pipelines.

## Project Name

ai_detective_agency

## Product Goals

- Develop a versatile AI-driven investigation platform
- Ensure high accuracy and reliability in investigations
- Provide a user-friendly interface for case management and AI interaction

## User Stories

- As a law enforcement officer, I want to input case details and receive comprehensive investigation leads from the AI
- As a business owner, I want to submit evidence of potential fraud and get a detailed analysis report
- As a private individual, I want to track digital footprints related to my case with the help of AI

## Competitive Analysis

- AI Detective Tool A: Advanced analytics but limited in user interaction
- Cyber Sleuth Software B: Good data integration, lacks AI specialization
- Investigation Suite C: Comprehensive toolset but not cloud-based
- Digital Investigator D: Cloud-based with real-time data tracking, but AI is not specialized
- Forensic AI Platform E: Specialized AI, but lacks comprehensive case management features

## Requirement Analysis

The application requires the integration of multiple AI models, each specializing in different aspects of private investigation such as data analysis, pattern recognition, and digital forensics. It must be capable of handling various types of digital evidence and provide actionable insights. The system should be cloud-compatible for accessibility and scalability. A comprehensive 'Read Me' file is necessary for guidance on usage and maintenance. The application must be robust, with a focus on passing Continuous Integration tests without issues.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Integration of specialized AI models for different investigation aspects']
- ['P0', 'Cloud compatibility and server deployment options']
- ['P0', "Comprehensive 'Read Me' file for guidance"]
- ['P1', 'User-friendly case management interface']
- ['P1', 'Continuous Integration compatibility with no failed pipelines']

## UI Design draft

The UI will feature a dashboard for case submissions, AI model selection, evidence upload, and report generation. It will have a clean, professional look with intuitive navigation.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The extent of 'working knowledge' for each AI model in different aspects of the firm needs clarification. Additionally, the specific technical proficiencies required for the AI models are not explicitly listed.

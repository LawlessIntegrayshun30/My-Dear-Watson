Develop an application that can be run from a server or the cloud that is essentially a team of Ai models that work together as a private investigation firm.  Each model can have a working knowledge of each aspect of the firm, but ultimately specializes in one of the technical proficiencies utilized by the firm to conduct thorough investigations.  These investigations could be for cyber crimes or matters of business and personal nature that don't necessarily happen in cyber space, but the firm can utilize digital information like CCTV feeds, credit card receipts, OSINT, etc to gather intel as it pertains to each case.  Please include a comprehensive "Read Me" file (not a Read Me generator).  Also please make it launch ready, and fully functional so that when it is put through Continuous Integration, there are no failed pipelines.

{"Implementation approach":"We will develop a modular system where each AI model is a separate component that can be integrated into the main application. We will use Python for its rich ecosystem of AI and machine learning libraries. For AI models, we will leverage open-source libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning tasks, spaCy for natural language processing, and OpenCV for image processing. The application will be designed to run on both servers and cloud platforms, with Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration to ensure scalability and easy deployment. A RESTful API will be implemented for interaction between the client-side and server-side, using Flask or FastAPI.","File list":["main.py","investigation_manager.py","ai_models.py","case.py","evidence.py","report.py","README.md"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        -InvestigationManager investigation_manager\n        +main() str\n    }\n    class InvestigationManager {\n        -CaseManager case_manager\n        -AIModelManager ai_model_manager\n        +create_case(case_data: dict)\n        +assign_ai_models(case_id: str)\n        +collect_evidence(case_id: str, evidence_data: dict)\n        +generate_report(case_id: str) str\n    }\n    class AIModelManager {\n        -AIModels ai_models\n        +load_models()\n        +run_investigation(case_id: str, evidence_data: dict)\n    }\n    class CaseManager {\n        -Case case\n        +create_case(case_data: dict)\n        +get_case(case_id: str) Case\n    }\n    class Case {\n        +case_id: str\n        +details: dict\n        +evidence: list\n        +report: Report\n        +add_evidence(evidence_data: dict)\n        +generate_report() Report\n    }\n    class Evidence {\n        +evidence_id: str\n        +type: str\n        +data: dict\n    }\n    class Report {\n        +report_id: str\n        +findings: dict\n    }\n    class AIModels {\n        +model_type: str\n        +specialization: str\n        +analyze(evidence: Evidence) dict\n    }\n    Main --> InvestigationManager\n    InvestigationManager --> CaseManager\n    InvestigationManager --> AIModelManager\n    CaseManager --> Case\n    Case --> Evidence\n    Case --> Report\n    AIModelManager --> AIModels\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant IM as InvestigationManager\n    participant CM as CaseManager\n    participant AMM as AIModelManager\n    participant C as Case\n    participant E as Evidence\n    participant R as Report\n    participant AM as AIModels\n    M->>IM: create_case(case_data)\n    IM->>CM: create_case(case_data)\n    CM-->>IM: case_id\n    IM->>AMM: load_models()\n    IM->>IM: assign_ai_models(case_id)\n    IM->>IM: collect_evidence(case_id, evidence_data)\n    loop For each evidence\n        IM->>C: add_evidence(evidence_data)\n        C->>E: create_evidence(evidence_data)\n    end\n    IM->>AMM: run_investigation(case_id, evidence_data)\n    AMM->>AM: analyze(E)\n    AM-->>AMM: findings\n    IM->>C: generate_report()\n    C->>R: create_report(findings)\n    R-->>C: report_id\n    C-->>IM: report\n    IM-->>M: return report\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The specific AI model specializations and the extent of their 'working knowledge' in different aspects of the firm are not fully defined. It is assumed that each AI model will have primary expertise, with secondary capabilities to support other models.
